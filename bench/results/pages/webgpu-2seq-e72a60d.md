## Headline numbers (long-article)

Engine: **WebGPU** (8 threads) · mode `live` · commit `e72a60d`

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Time to first visible translated paragraph | 1.1 s |
| Full page translated | 21.6 s |
| Remaining work after the first paragraph | 20.4 s |

These are the two numbers to cite from a `live` run. Mock numbers measure the
scheduler, not the model, and must not be presented as translation speed.
